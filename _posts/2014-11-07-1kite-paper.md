For the last several years, I have been working with the 1,000 Insect Transcriptome Evolution [(1KITE)](http://1kite.org) project. It is a large international collaborative team from many different countries. Our first paper presenting a phylogeny of insects using transcriptomes from over 100 species has just been published. It was a great pleasure of mine to be a part of the team, many thanks to all of the authors, especially the project leads, Dr. Bernhard Misof and Dr. Xin Zhou. You can find the paper [here](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6210/763). We have also had some good press about the paper. Two articles that I enjoyed are from [WIRED](http://www.wired.com/2014/11/when-did-insects-evolve/) and [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/06/us-science-insects-idUSKBN0IQ2DS20141106).
